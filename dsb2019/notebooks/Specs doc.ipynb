This event differs from events 3020 and 3021 as it captures instructions that are not given in response to player action. These events are used to determine the effectiveness of the instructions. We can answer questions like \"did players who received instruction X do better than those who did not?\""

       "The system-initiated instruction event occurs when the game delivers instructions to the player. It contains information that describes the content of the instruction. This event differs from events 3020 and 3021 as it captures instructions that are not given in response to player action. These events are used to determine the effectiveness of the instructions. We can answer questions like \"did players who received instruction X do better than those who did not?\""
